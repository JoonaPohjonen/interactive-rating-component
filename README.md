  ## Overview

  This rating component is a simple web application that can be integrated as a part of a larger apllication or website. The app makes it possible to receive user feedback in a professional manner. Application is stylished in dark greyish coloring with orange buttons. Screen will cahnge into a "thank you"- screen when feedback is submited. This project was ment to be re-introduction into HTML5 since I had not used it in a while. It also worked as a reminder into the world of CSS. Some simple JavaScript was also used in the app.
